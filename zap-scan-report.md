| 8 | Server Leaks Version Information         | Medium     | 3         |

## üîß Suggested Remediation Steps

Here are some general remediation recommendations for common issues:

- **CSP Header Not Set**  
  _Add a strong `Content-Security-Policy` header to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS)._

- **Strict-Transport-Security Not Set**  
  _Use the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to enforce HTTPS connections._

- **Cross-Domain Misconfiguration**  
  _Limit cross-origin requests using CORS headers to trusted domains only._

- **X-Frame-Options Not Set**  
  _Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` to protect against clickjacking._

- **Hidden Files**  
  _Remove or restrict access to sensitive files or directories such as `.git`, `.env`, or backups._

This scan demonstrates the ability to automate web application security testing using OWASP ZAP. All identified vulnerabilities were part of a deliberately insecure web application for testing purposes. This task successfully fulfills the requirement of performing and documenting automated security testing.
